Hi Sir / Madam,

Sorry to bother.

I am a MetaMask Wallet owner instead of a user of your platform.

This monring, I got scammed and all my assets were stolen. I just want to give you the information of the scammer's address and transaction details. I hope your platform could blacklist this address and freeze any transaction in/out from it.

Scammer's address:
0xd3eb6e7A036acB410c66F582DA124fEB58947AFf
https://etherscan.io/address/0xd3eb6e7a036acb410c66f582da124feb58947aff

Transaction details:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3066eba232861973798539981173ebf917748b61b154442ea8ff0af4af4277df

Thank you very much.

Orion
